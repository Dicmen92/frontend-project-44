# Mind games

## Installation

Before using the application, you must install all dependencies for this project.

```sh
npm install
```

After completing the above step, we are presented with an application that includes five exciting mini-games.

### 1. Game: "Parity Check"
[Project demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/42XC5kEiVL19eoIXmxzuok45X)

```sh
brain-even
```

*It is necessary to implement the game "Check for parity". The essence of the game is this: the user is shown a random number. And he needs to answer yes if the number is even, or no if it’s odd.*

### 2. Game: "Calculator"
[Project demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/dxUDm1c5t0eSpJaPBcqiMlnXN)

```sh
brain-calc
```

*It is necessary to implement the game "Calculator". The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown a random mathematical expression, for example 35 + 16, which must be calculated and the correct answer written down.*

### 3. Game "GCD"
[Project demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/ia1Lqxlwj6b7W5xfXDz4hBLcO)

```sh
brain-gcd
```

*It is necessary to implement the game "Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)". The essence of the game is as follows: the user is shown two random numbers, for example, 25 50. The user must calculate and enter the greatest common divisor of these numbers.*

### 4. Game: "Arithmetic progression"
[Project demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/7YsSzedYIcktlztxNLOX5K8JX)

```sh
brain-progression
```

*We show the player a series of numbers forming an arithmetic progression, replacing any of the numbers with two dots. The player must determine this number.*

### 5. Game "Is the number prime?"
[Project demonstration](https://asciinema.org/a/7qDZu1mgfrp2JUJVWzkYgHkTE)

```sh
brain-prime
```

*It is necessary to implement the game “Is the number prime?” The essence of the game is to check a number for simplicity. The player is given a number and his task is to determine whether it is prime. A prime number is a natural number greater than one that is divisible only by 1 and itself.*
